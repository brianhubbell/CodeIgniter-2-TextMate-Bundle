TextMate Bundle for CodeIgniter 2.x 
=============

This is based on the [bundle for CodeIgniter 1.7.2][ci1bundle]. It will include up-to-date snippets for all the functions in the latest version of CodeIgniter 2.x. 

To install, just download/checkout the file and double click it.

As the bundle grows bigger I'll document it abit better here, but for now all you need to know is everything is prefixed with 'ci', so typing 'cicontroller' flowed by [TAB] in an empty .php file will created a new basic controller.
